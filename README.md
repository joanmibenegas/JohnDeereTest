Hello my name is Joan Miquel, thank you for that opportunity.

To build my application we only need open the project with IntellIJ.

Create a run configuration with the following params on the "Run" box:
"clean install -DskipTests"

Wait until the finish.

To run the application the following ports are required:
1-. 22181
2-. 29092, 9092
3-. 6868

Go to the root of project and execute docker-compose up -d

There are a JSON with importable postman collection at root of project.

Thank you!
